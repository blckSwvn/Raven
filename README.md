# http server

## name: idk yet

im trying to make a high performance http server so
mult threaded with worker threads using my own allocator `salloc`
all in C btw including `salloc`

it will be 86x-64x only due to allocator but may be subject to change.
also it will be using pthreads so posix aka not windows so linux.
